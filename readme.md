## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

### üìå Business Case Summary
The **Aurora House Price Prediction Dashboard** was built to address a common challenge in the real estate market:  
**how to accurately estimate the fair value of a house.**  

Property valuation is often inconsistent and highly subjective. Sellers may overprice properties to maximize profit, while buyers risk overpaying due to lack of reliable insights.  
By leveraging **historical housing data from Ames, Iowa**, Aurora applies **machine learning** to deliver accurate, data-backed price predictions.  

The project follows a structured **CRISP-DM process** to align technical outcomes with business goals. Starting from data exploration and cleaning, to building and evaluating a predictive pipeline, and finally deploying a live dashboard‚ÄîAurora ensures the solution is practical, transparent, and actionable.

---

### üéØ Client Requirements
Through the business case assessment, the client highlighted two critical needs:

1. **Understand Attribute Correlations**  
   - The client wants to know how various housing features (such as living area, overall quality, year built, and neighborhood) correlate with sale price.  
   - The expectation is to generate clear **visual insights** (plots, charts, correlation studies) that explain price drivers.  

2. **Predict House Sale Prices**  
   - The client wants to use a trained ML model to predict the sales price of:  
     - Their four inherited houses  
     - Any other house in Ames, Iowa (via manual form inputs or CSV uploads)  
   - The solution must be integrated into a **user-friendly dashboard** where results are displayed with clear interpretation.  

Additionally:
- The system must achieve **R¬≤ ‚â• 0.75** on both training and test sets (as agreed performance target).  
- The dashboard should include project summary, hypothesis validation, technical details, and downloadable outputs.  

---

### üí° Value Delivered to Stakeholders
Aurora delivers tangible value to **multiple groups of stakeholders**:

- **For Homeowners & Sellers**  
  - They can compare their intended listing price against the model‚Äôs prediction.  
  - The app provides clear feedback on whether the property is **overpriced, underpriced, or fairly valued**, helping sellers make smarter decisions before entering the market.

- **For Buyers**  
  - Buyers gain transparency into the factors influencing house prices.  
  - They can avoid overpaying by referencing Aurora‚Äôs model predictions as a benchmark for negotiations.

- **For Real Estate Agents & Landlords**  
  - Aurora becomes a **decision-support tool** for property valuation.  
  - Agents can use the app to build trust with clients by showing data-backed price estimates.  
  - Landlords can assess whether inherited or newly acquired properties are competitive in the market.

- **For Data Practitioners & Business Analysts**  
  - The dashboard serves as an example of how machine learning can be **operationalized into real-world business tools**.  
  - It bridges the gap between raw data science workflows and a final, stakeholder-ready product.

---

### ‚úÖ Why Aurora Matters
By providing both **analytical insights** (visualizations) and **predictive intelligence** (ML-powered valuation), Aurora ensures that decision-making in real estate is guided by **evidence rather than intuition**.  
The project demonstrates how a machine learning solution can directly align with **business objectives** and **user needs**, delivering lasting impact in a professional environment.

---
## üîÑ CRISP-DM Framework

The **Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)** serves as the backbone of the Aurora project.  
It ensures that every step of the data science workflow is directly aligned with business needs, from problem definition to deployment.  
Aurora follows the six sequential phases of CRISP-DM as outlined below:

---

### 1. **Business Understanding**
- Define the problem: estimating house prices accurately to support fair property transactions.  
- Identify stakeholder requirements:
  - Visualize correlations between housing features and sale price.  
  - Predict house prices reliably for both individual houses and batch data.  
- Establish success criteria: achieve **R¬≤ ‚â• 0.75** on both train and test sets.  
- Value: minimize pricing risks for sellers and buyers, while providing agents and landlords with actionable intelligence.

---

### 2. **Data Understanding**
- Source: **Ames Housing Dataset** (Kaggle).  
- Composition: ~2,900 rows, 80+ variables covering structural details, quality ratings, and neighborhood information.  
- Initial steps:  
  - Load dataset into Pandas DataFrame.  
  - Generate descriptive statistics for the target variable `SalePrice`.  
  - Explore distributions and correlations.  
- Key insight: certain features (e.g., **OverallQual, GrLivArea, YearBuilt**) show strong positive correlation with price.

---

### 3. **Data Preparation**
- Handle missing values via **SimpleImputer**:
  - Numeric ‚Üí median strategy  
  - Categorical ‚Üí most frequent strategy  
- Encode categorical variables using **OneHotEncoder** (with `handle_unknown="ignore"`).  
- Scale numeric variables using **StandardScaler**.  
- Define features (X) and target (y = SalePrice).  
- Perform **train/test split (80/20)** with random_state=42 for reproducibility.  
- Ensure prepared datasets are suitable for modeling.

---

### 4. **Modeling**
- Selected algorithm: **RandomForestRegressor** (robust to outliers, handles categorical encoding, strong baseline).  
- Integrated into a **Pipeline** combining preprocessing + model.  
- Trained model using `X_train, y_train`.  
- Saved trained pipeline using **joblib** for reuse in Streamlit app.  
- Feature importance extracted to highlight most influential attributes.

---

### 5. **Evaluation**
- Metrics:
  - **R¬≤ score** for both training and test sets.  
  - **Actual vs Predicted plots** for visual validation.  
- Performance achieved: R¬≤ exceeded the 0.75 threshold, satisfying business success criteria.  
- Stored evaluation results in `assets/metrics.json` for dashboard integration.  
- Produced insights such as:
  - Larger living areas strongly drive price.  
  - Overall quality rating is a critical determinant.  
  - Neighborhood introduces substantial variance.

---

### 6. **Deployment**
- Built an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit**.  
- Deployed on **Render** for public access:  
  üëâ [Aurora Housing App](https://aurora-housing.onrender.com/)  
- Dashboard features:
  - **Summary**: project overview, metrics, key plots.  
  - **Correlations**: visualization of attribute-price relationships.  
  - **Predict**: single-form and batch CSV prediction.  
  - **Hypotheses**: tested business assumptions.  
  - **Tech**: pipeline steps and model metrics.  
- Value: delivers machine learning predictions and data insights to stakeholders in real time.

---

## üéØ Business Understanding

### üìå Problem Background
Accurately estimating property prices is one of the biggest challenges in the real estate market.  
- Sellers risk **overpricing**, leading to longer time on the market and potential financial losses.  
- Buyers risk **overpaying**, especially in competitive markets without access to fair valuation tools.  
- Agents and landlords often rely on **experience or subjective judgement**, which may not reflect real market dynamics.  

To solve this problem, Aurora leverages **historical housing data from Ames, Iowa** and applies **machine learning** to generate accurate, consistent, and data-driven price predictions.

---

### üíº Business Drivers
The motivation for this project stems from several business needs:
- **Efficiency**: Quickly evaluate house prices without relying solely on manual appraisals.  
- **Transparency**: Provide stakeholders with clear insights into how different features affect price.  
- **Fairness**: Ensure that property transactions are based on evidence rather than guesswork.  
- **Scalability**: Build a system that can be reused for many houses, not just a single appraisal.  
- **Innovation**: Demonstrate how machine learning can improve real-world decision-making in real estate.  

---

### üë• Stakeholder Expectations
Different stakeholders benefit from Aurora in distinct ways:
- **Sellers & Landlords**: Want to know if their intended listing price is realistic compared to the market.  
- **Buyers**: Expect a tool that signals whether a house is fairly valued, overpriced, or undervalued.  
- **Real Estate Agents**: Need a reliable assistant to validate pricing strategies and build trust with clients.  
- **Business Analysts & Data Practitioners**: Expect a professional ML solution that demonstrates the full CRISP-DM workflow and is deployable as a live dashboard.  

---

### üß™ Hypotheses
Aurora was guided by a set of testable hypotheses during development:
1. **Larger living areas strongly correlate with higher sale prices** ‚úÖ  
   - Confirmed: Square footage of above-ground living area is one of the strongest predictors.  

2. **Newer houses tend to sell for more** ‚úÖ  
   - Confirmed: YearBuilt and YearRemodAdd show positive correlation with sale price.  

3. **Neighborhood significantly impacts property value** ‚úÖ  
   - Confirmed: Houses in certain neighborhoods consistently sell for higher or lower than average.  

4. **Overall quality rating is a key driver of price** ‚úÖ  
   - Confirmed: The `OverallQual` variable is one of the top features in the model‚Äôs importance ranking.

---

üìå By validating these hypotheses, Aurora ensures that the **machine learning pipeline is aligned with business reality** and that the final dashboard delivers insights that truly matter to its stakeholders.

---

## üìä Data Understanding  

### üìÇ Dataset Description  
This project uses the **Ames Housing dataset**, a benchmark dataset in predictive modeling and real-estate price estimation. The dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock (Truman State University) as a modern alternative to the Boston Housing dataset and has since become a standard for machine learning competitions and academic research.  

It contains **2,930 individual residential property sales** in Ames, Iowa, from **2006 to 2010**, and includes **over 80 explanatory variables** that describe nearly every aspect of a home, ranging from lot size and neighborhood to garage quality and basement condition.  

The **target variable** for prediction is:  
- **SalePrice** ‚Üí the final sale price of each house in USD.  

This makes the dataset ideal for a **regression problem** where the objective is to predict continuous outcomes based on heterogeneous structured data.  

---

### üîë Key Features  
While the dataset is rich with dozens of features, prior research and exploratory analysis consistently highlight several **high-impact predictors** of house price:  

- **LotArea** ‚Üí Lot square footage, measuring the size of the property.  
- **OverallQual** ‚Üí An ordinal variable (1‚Äì10) rating the overall material and finish quality. This is one of the most influential drivers of price.  
- **YearBuilt** ‚Üí The construction year of the property, serving as a proxy for modernization.  
- **GrLivArea** ‚Üí Above-ground living area (square feet), another strong positive predictor of price.  
- **Neighborhood** ‚Üí Categorical variable identifying physical locations within Ames. Location acts as a critical determinant of property value.  

Additional influential attributes discovered through correlation analysis include:  
- **GarageArea** ‚Üí Larger garages increase sale value.  
- **TotalBsmtSF** ‚Üí Basement size directly impacts living space and price.  
- **YearRemodAdd** ‚Üí Remodeling year, capturing the effect of renovations.  
- **ExterQual** ‚Üí Categorical measure of exterior quality.  

---

### üìà Initial Observations (EDA)  
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) produced several insights about the distribution of prices and the relationship between features:  

- **SalePrice distribution** ‚Üí The variable is right-skewed, with a heavy concentration of homes selling in the **$120k‚Äì$200k** range. A small subset of luxury homes exceeds **$500k**. Log transformation can help normalize this skewness for modeling.  

- **Correlations** ‚Üí Features such as **OverallQual**, **GrLivArea**, and **YearBuilt** show the strongest positive correlation with SalePrice. These features are highly predictive and align with domain knowledge.  

- **Neighborhood effect** ‚Üí Prices differ dramatically by neighborhood. For example:  
  - **NridgHt** (Northridge Heights) and **StoneBr** (Stone Brook) show consistently higher prices.  
  - **MeadowV** (Meadow Village) and **Edwards** tend to have lower prices.  
  This emphasizes the strong **location premium** effect in real-estate.  

- **Outliers** ‚Üí A handful of homes (e.g., very large `GrLivArea > 4000 sq ft`) sold for significantly lower than expected values, which could impact model performance if not handled properly.  

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Values & Data Quality  
The dataset is generally well-structured, but certain columns contain **systematic missing values**:  

- **Alley, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature** ‚Üí Missing values indicate absence of the feature (e.g., no alley access, no pool).  
- **LotFrontage** ‚Üí Missing for ~17% of observations, likely due to measurement gaps.  
- **GarageYrBlt, BsmtQual, FireplaceQu** ‚Üí Missing when the property lacks that particular feature.  

These patterns are **not random** but **domain-driven**, meaning careful imputation strategies can be applied:  
- Fill categorical NA values with `"None"` (e.g., no pool, no fence).  
- Impute numeric values with median (e.g., LotFrontage).  
- Retain missingness where it holds predictive signal (e.g., having no basement is itself a feature).  

This data quality assessment guided preprocessing and pipeline construction in later steps.  

---

### üì∑ Visual Insights  
To make the data understanding phase more tangible, several plots were generated:  
- **SalePrice Distribution Histogram** ‚Üí Showing skewed distribution with long tail.  
  ![SalePrice Distribution](assets/saleprice_hist.png)  

- **Correlation Heatmap** ‚Üí Highlighting top numeric features correlated with SalePrice.  
  ![Correlation Heatmap](assets/top_corr_numeric.png)  

- **Neighborhood Price Boxplots** ‚Üí Visualizing the spread of house prices across different neighborhoods.  
  ![Neighborhood Boxplot](assets/neighborhood_boxplot.png)  
---

## üßπ Data Preparation  

The Ames Housing dataset required several cleaning and transformation steps before modeling. This phase ensured data quality, consistency, and readiness for machine learning.  

---

### üßº Cleaning Steps  
- **Handled missing values**:  
  - Numerical columns such as `LotFrontage` were imputed with the **median**.  
  - Categorical columns like `Alley`, `Fence`, and `MiscFeature` were imputed with **"None"**, representing absence of that feature.  
  - Garage and basement attributes were imputed based on domain logic (e.g., houses without basements received "NoBsmt").  
- **Dropped non-informative identifiers**: Columns like `Order` and `PID` were removed since they do not contribute predictive value.  
- **Outlier detection**: Inspected `GrLivArea` and `SalePrice` scatterplots to identify extreme outliers. A few were trimmed to improve model generalization.  
![Handled missing values](assets/missing-value-finding.png)  
---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Engineering  
- **Created simplified feature sets**:  
  For initial modeling and deployment, we selected five primary features known to correlate strongly with sale price:  
  - `LotArea`  
  - `OverallQual`  
  - `YearBuilt`  
  - `GrLivArea`  
  - `Neighborhood`  
- **Categorical encoding**: `Neighborhood` was treated as a categorical variable and encoded using **OneHotEncoder**.  
- **Scaling numeric features**: `LotArea`, `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`, and `GrLivArea` were scaled using **StandardScaler** to normalize ranges.  
![Simplified feature sets](assets/feature-engineering.png)  
---

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Train/Test Split  
- **Features (X)**: Defined as the engineered features above.  
- **Target (y)**: `SalePrice`.  
- Data was split into **80% training** and **20% testing** using `train_test_split(random_state=42)` to ensure reproducibility.  
![Training sets](assets/training-set.png)  
---

### üèóÔ∏è Preprocessing Pipeline  
To ensure consistency between training and deployment:  
- **Numeric pipeline**:  
  - `SimpleImputer(strategy="median")`  
  - `StandardScaler(with_mean=False)`  
- **Categorical pipeline**:  
  - `SimpleImputer(strategy="most_frequent")`  
  - `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore")`  
![Pipeline model](assets/pipline-code.png)  
- **Final pipeline**: Combined preprocessing with a **RandomForestRegressor** as the estimator.  

This pipeline was defined using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` from `scikit-learn`, ensuring that raw user inputs (numeric + categorical) can be seamlessly processed for both training and predictions in the Streamlit app.  

![Final pipeline](assets/pipeline.png) 

---

## ü§ñ Modeling  

The predictive engine of **Aurora** is designed using a robust Machine Learning pipeline that integrates preprocessing and regression modeling.  

---

### üèóÔ∏è ML Pipeline Design  
The pipeline was implemented with **scikit-learn** and structured into three main stages:  
1. **Preprocessing**  
   - Numeric features: imputation (median) + scaling (StandardScaler).  
   - Categorical features: imputation (most frequent) + encoding (OneHotEncoder).  
2. **Feature transformation** via `ColumnTransformer`.  
3. **Regression model**: applied directly to transformed features.  

This design ensures **consistency** between training, evaluation, and live predictions within the Streamlit application.  

---

### ‚ö° Algorithms Used  
- **RandomForestRegressor** (primary model):  
  - Chosen for its robustness to outliers, ability to model nonlinear relationships, and interpretability via feature importance.  
- Alternative models (explored during experimentation but not deployed):  
  - Linear Regression ‚Üí baseline performance.  
  - Gradient Boosting ‚Üí promising but computationally heavier with limited marginal gain for this dataset.  

![Model](assets/pipeline.png) 

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Hyperparameters  
The deployed RandomForestRegressor used the following configuration:  
- `n_estimators = 200`  
- `max_depth = None` (allowing full tree growth)  
- `random_state = 42` for reproducibility  
- `n_jobs = -1` to enable parallel computation  

While hyperparameter tuning (e.g., via GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV) was explored, the default settings with modest adjustments delivered a solid balance between performance and model size for deployment.  

---

### üìö Training Details  
- **Train/Test Split**: 80% train, 20% test.  
- **Success Criterion**: Business requirement defined success as achieving **R¬≤ ‚â• 0.75** on both training and testing sets.  
- **Model Training**: Completed successfully, with the pipeline fitted on ~2,340 training examples.  
- **Feature Importance**: Top predictors included `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, `Neighborhood`, and `YearBuilt`.  

![Feature importance](assets/feature_importance_top30.png) 

---

## üìà Evaluation  

The evaluation phase validated the trained model against business success criteria and provided insights into model performance.  

---

### üìä Metrics Used  
- **R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination)**  
  - Measures proportion of variance in `SalePrice` explained by the model.  
  - Evaluated on both training and test sets.  
- **Visual Diagnostics**  
  - **Actual vs Predicted plots** (train & test)
  - **Residual analysis** to inspect errors and ensure no major systematic bias.  

![Actual vs Predictive plot](assets/actual_vs_pred_train.png) 
---

### üéØ Success Criteria  
- Business requirement specified: **R¬≤ ‚â• 0.75** on both training and test sets.  
- Achieved:  
  - Train R¬≤ ‚âà **0.86**  
  - Test R¬≤ ‚âà **0.78**  
- ‚úÖ The model **meets the defined success threshold** and is suitable for deployment.  

---

### üåü Feature Importance  
The **RandomForestRegressor** provides a ranking of features by predictive power.  
- Top contributors included:  
  - `OverallQual` (overall material/finish quality)  
  - `GrLivArea` (above-ground living area)  
  - `Neighborhood` (location effect)  
  - `YearBuilt` (construction year)  
- Visualization:  
  - `assets/feature_importance_top30.png` shows the **top 30 features ranked by importance**.  

![Feature importance](assets/feature_importance_top30.png) 

---

### üîç Model Validation  
- **Cross-validation** performed on training folds confirmed stable performance across splits.  
- **Overfitting check**: gap between train (0.86) and test (0.78) indicates the model generalizes reasonably well.  
- **Edge case inspection**: extreme luxury homes and very old houses showed slightly higher error margins, which is expected due to fewer training examples in those categories.  

![AI model](assets/model-meets-logic.png)

## üêû Known Issues / Bugs  

While the Aurora project meets its core objectives, there are a few known limitations and areas for future improvement:  

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Model-Related  
- **Feature Limitation**: The deployed pipeline currently uses a subset of features (`LotArea`, `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`, `GrLivArea`, `Neighborhood`).  
  - This reduces dimensionality but may lower predictive power compared to a full-feature model.  
- **Overfitting Risk**: RandomForestRegressor may overfit if hyperparameters are not tuned further (currently using default parameters).  
- **Prediction Stability**: For some inputs, the model may output very similar prices, as categorical encodings (like `Neighborhood`) are limited by training distribution.  

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data-Related  
- **Neighborhood Coverage**: If a user inputs a neighborhood not seen in training data, predictions may fail or default to fallback encoding.  
- **Outliers**: Extremely large or small values (e.g., LotArea > 50,000) may result in unrealistic predictions.  
- **Historical Dataset**: The Ames Housing dataset is slightly dated and may not fully reflect modern housing market trends.  

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Dashboard / Deployment  
- **File Upload Sensitivity**: CSV uploads must exactly match expected column names (`LotArea`, `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`, `GrLivArea`, `Neighborhood`). Any mismatch leads to errors.  
- **Rendering Performance**: Large batch CSV predictions may cause slower response times on free-tier hosting.  
- **Image Dependencies**: Dashboard plots (`assets/`) must exist; missing files will break visualizations.  

---

### üí° Notes for Improvement  
- Expand feature set to include **more predictors** (e.g., Garage, Bathrooms, Lot Shape).  
- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV) for better accuracy.  
- Add **error handling** for unseen categories and invalid inputs.  
- Implement **interactive plots** using Plotly for richer exploration.  
- Add **REST API endpoint** for easier integration with external apps (e.g., React frontend).
